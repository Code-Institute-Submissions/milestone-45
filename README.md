# CODE INSTITUTE: MILESTONE PROJECT 1

# ENGLISH WINE: A REFERENCE GUIDE

![site display on different screens](/assets/images/readme/responsive.png)

This website was designed to give the user a "one stop reference guide" for the wine industry in England. Brief information about the various counties that produce wine, the current producers in the market and the wines available from these producers. 

This is the first of four Milestone Projects required for the Full Stack Web Development course provided by Code Institute. The main goal for this project was to produce a "static front-end site to present useful information to the users" using HTML and CSS.

## UX  ##

### Project Goals ###

The main aim of this project was to create a website that would give the user a single site to visit that would allow them to access other sites to gain more information, eg Wikipedia and contact details of current wine producers.

### User Stories ###

- As a **new user / customer**, I want to learn more about the regions in England that produce wine.
- As a **new user / customer**, I want to learn more about the various producers in England and get in touch with them to arrange winery visits.
- As a **new user / customer**, I want to learn more about the wines currently being produced in England and buy them direct from the producer cutting out the "middle man".
- As a **producer**, I want to have contact details for my peers in an easy to use website.
- As a **producer**, I want to see what new wine is being launched on to the market by my peers.
- As a **wine supplier**, I want to be able to contact producers direct and get that information easily.
- As a **wine supplier**, I want to be able to see what new wine is being launce on to the market by existing producers.

##### Fonts #####

I chose the Mulish font family for my headers and the Poppins font family for my body text as I liked the simplicity of their styles. Both fonts were chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

##### Colours #####

I used a "Racing Green" colour for the Navigation Bar and Footer and then used [www.0to255.com](www.0to255.com) to pick complimentary colours to work with for the buttons and cards throughout the project. The black and white image for index.html was used as I felt it gave the site a professional feel. 

##### Wireframes #####

The site mock-ups were designed using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). I concentrated on how the different pages would look on different screen resolutions and mapped the corresponding elements on desktop, tablet and mobile screens accordingly. The varietals page changed during the coding process to become wines as I felt that this was more relevant to the various users.

A full version of the wireframes can be seen here.

## Technology Used ##

### Languages and Frameworks ###

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - this was used for the modal form and also for the "scroll up" button to allow the user to return to the top of the screen.  The JS code for this was borrowed from the W3 Schools website after a search to find out how to create this.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) - all icons were taken from this site.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - I relied on Bootstrap for the responsive grid design, carousel and card components.
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - as previously stated, the fonts used were taken from here.
- [Popper](https://popper.js.org/)
- [Popper JS](https://popper.js.org/)
  
### Tools ###

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - version control and recording of all changes to site during development process
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - used for hosting website
- GitPod - IDE used for code editing. 
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - wireframing
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - used to select font families
- [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - used to test my HTML to ensure there were no errors
- [W3C Validator CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - used to test my CSS to ensure there were no errors
- [0to255.com](www.0to255.com) - color picker
- [Free Formatter]( https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html#ad-output) - html formatter to help keep things tidy!
- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) - used to create responsive images for readme.MD

## Deployment ##

The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages]().

Deployment was achieved by clicking on settings in the repo for the site, scrolling down to the GitHub Pages section, selecting the "master" branch and clicking save. This allowed me to share the site with my peers and make it live.
